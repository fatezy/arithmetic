// the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security system connected and
// it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.
//
//        Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum
// amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.
    //我是一个抢劫犯，不可以抢相邻的房子，如何抢到最多的钱
