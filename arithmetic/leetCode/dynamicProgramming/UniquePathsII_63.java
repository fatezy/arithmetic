//Follow up for "Unique Paths":
//
//        Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?
//
//        An obstacle and empty space is marked as 1 and 0 respectively in the grid.
//
//        For example,
//        There is one obstacle in the middle of a 3x3 grid as illustrated below.
//
//        [
//        [0,0,0],
//        [0,1,0],
//        [0,0,0]
//        ]
//        The total number of unique paths is 2.
    //给你一个相关的图，1代表障碍，0代表非障碍
